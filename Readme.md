# Example repository for ERA mods.

The mod files must be located in the root of the repository, without subdirectories.

It is recommended to place the mod description text in English (caption->en_US) in the README.md file. In this case, the text from this file will be displayed alongside the mod files on the repository page. (This text is also made this way)
Text formatting using [Markdown:](https://docs.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) is supported.

The mod icon can be in formats other than .ico, such as png/jpg/bmp. But in this case, they will not be displayed in the mod manager.

**Important!**
File names in mod.json must be specified with case sensitivity.
